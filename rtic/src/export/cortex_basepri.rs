/// Lock implementation using BASEPRI and global Critical Section (CS)

/// # Safety
///
/// The system ceiling is raised from current to ceiling
/// by either
/// - raising the BASEPRI to the ceiling value, or
/// - disable all interrupts in case we want to
///   mask interrupts with maximum priority
///
/// Dereferencing a raw pointer inside CS
///
/// The priority.set/priority.get can safely be outside the CS
/// as being a context local cell (not affected by preemptions).
/// It is merely used in order to omit masking in case current
/// priority is current priority >= ceiling.
///
/// Lock Efficiency:
/// Experiments validate (sub)-zero cost for CS implementation
/// (Sub)-zero as:
/// - Either zero OH (lock optimized out), or
/// - Amounting to an optimal assembly implementation
///   - The BASEPRI value is folded to a constant at compile time
///   - CS entry, single assembly instruction to write BASEPRI
///   - CS exit, single assembly instruction to write BASEPRI
///   - priority.set/get optimized out (their effect not)
/// - On par or better than any handwritten implementation of SRP
///
/// Limitations:
/// The current implementation reads/writes BASEPRI once
/// even in some edge cases where this may be omitted.
/// Total OH of per task is max 2 clock cycles, negligible in practice
/// but can in theory be fixed.
