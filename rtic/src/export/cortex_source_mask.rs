/// 1: ceiling >= priority > current
/// 0: else
///
/// On CS entry, `clear_enable_mask(mask)` disables interrupts
/// On CS exit,  `set_enable_mask(mask)` re-enables interrupts
///
/// The priority.set/priority.get can safely be outside the CS
/// as being a context local cell (not affected by preemptions).
/// It is merely used in order to omit masking in case
/// current priority >= ceiling.
///
/// Dereferencing a raw pointer is done safely inside the CS
///
/// Lock Efficiency:
/// Early experiments validate (sub)-zero cost for CS implementation
/// (Sub)-zero as:
/// - Either zero OH (lock optimized out), or
/// - Amounting to an optimal assembly implementation
///   - if ceiling == (1 << nvic_prio_bits)
///     - we execute the closure in a global critical section (interrupt free)
///     - CS entry cost, single write to core register
///     - CS exit cost, single write to core register
///   else
///     - The `mask` value is folded to a constant at compile time
///     - CS entry, single write of the 32 bit `mask` to the `icer` register
///     - CS exit, single write of the 32 bit `mask` to the `iser` register
/// - priority.set/get optimized out (their effect not)
/// - On par or better than any hand written implementation of SRP
///
/// Limitations:
/// Current implementation does not allow for tasks with shared resources
/// to be bound to exception handlers, as these cannot be masked in HW.
///
/// Possible solutions:
/// - Mask exceptions by global critical sections (interrupt::free)
/// - Temporary lower exception priority
///
/// These possible solutions are set goals for future work
