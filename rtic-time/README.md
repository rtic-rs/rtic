## Content

The main contribution of this crate is to define the [`Monotonic`](https://docs.rs/rtic-time/latest/rtic_time/trait.Monotonic.html) trait. It serves as a standardized interface for libraries to interact with the system's monotonic timers.

Additionally, this crate provides tools and utilities that help with implementing monotonic timers.

## Implementations of the `Monotonic` trait

For implementations of [`Monotonic`](https://docs.rs/rtic-time/latest/rtic_time/trait.Monotonic.html)
on various hardware, see [`rtic-monotonics`](https://docs.rs/rtic-monotonics/).
