## Features

- **Tasks** as the unit of concurrency [^1]. Tasks can be *event triggered*
  (fired in response to asynchronous stimuli) or spawned by the application on
  demand.

- **Message passing** between tasks. Specifically, messages can be passed to
  software tasks at spawn time.

- **A timer queue** [^2]. Software tasks can be scheduled to run at some time
  in the future. This feature can be used to implement periodic tasks.

- Support for prioritization of tasks and, thus, **preemptive multitasking**.

- **Efficient and data race free memory sharing** through fine-grained *priority
  based* critical sections [^1].

- **Deadlock free execution** guaranteed at compile time. This is a stronger
  guarantee than what's provided by [the standard `Mutex`
  abstraction][std-mutex].

[std-mutex]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html

- **Minimal scheduling overhead**. The task scheduler has minimal software
  footprint; the hardware does the bulk of the scheduling.

- **Highly efficient memory usage**: All the tasks share a single call stack and
  there's no hard dependency on a dynamic memory allocator.

- **All Cortex-M devices are fully supported**.

- This task model is amenable to known WCET (Worst Case Execution Time) analysis
  and scheduling analysis techniques.

## Running tests locally

To check all `Run-pass tests` locally on your `thumbv6m-none-eabi` or `thumbv7m-none-eabi` target device, run

```console
$ cargo xtask --target <your target>
#                       ˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆ
#                   e.g. thumbv7m-none-eabi
```

## Acknowledgments

This crate is based on the [Real-Time For the Masses language][rtfm-lang]
created by the Embedded Systems group at [Luleå University of Technology][ltu],
led by [Prof. Per Lindgren][perl].
