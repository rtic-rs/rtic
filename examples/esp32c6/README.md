### ESP32-C6 RTIC template
This crate showcases a simple RTIC application for the ESP32-C6.

## Prerequisites

# Espressif toolchain

This crate uses the most convenient option in ``cargo-espflash`` and ``espflash``
```cargo install cargo-espflash espflash```

## Running the crate

```cargo run --example sw_and_hw --features=riscv-esp32c6-backend (--release)```

should do the trick.

# Expected behavior
The example ``sw_and_hw``
- Prints ``init``
- Enters a high prio task
- During the execution of the high prio task, the button should be non-functional
- Pends a low prio task
- Exits the high prio task
- Enters the low prio task
- During the execution of the low prio task, the button should be functional.
- Exits the low prio task
- Prints ``idle``

The example ``monotonic``
- Prints ``init``
- Spawns the ``foo``, ``bar``, ``baz`` tasks (because of hardware interrupt latency dispatch, the order here may vary).
- Each task prints ``hello from $TASK`` on entry
- The tasks wait for 1, 2, 3 seconds respectively
- Once the wait period is over, each task exits printing ``bye from $TASK`` (now in the proper order).
