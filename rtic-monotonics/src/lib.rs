//! In-tree implementations of the [`rtic_time::Monotonic`] (reexported) trait for
//! timers & clocks found on commonly used microcontrollers.
//!
//! To enable the implementations, you must enable a feature for the specific MCU you're targeting.
//!
//! # Cortex-M Systick
//! The [`systick`] monotonic works on all cortex-M parts, and requires that the feature `cortex-m-systick` is enabled.
//!
//! # RP2040
//! The RP2040 monotonics require that the `rp2040` feature is enabled.
//!
//! # nRF
//! nRF monotonics require that one of the available `nrf52*` features is enabled.
//!
//! All implementations of timers for the nRF52 family are documented here. Monotonics that
//! are not available on all parts in this family will have an `Available on crate features X only`
//! tag, describing what parts _do_ support that monotonic. Monotonics without an
//! `Available on crate features X only` tag are available on any `nrf52*` feature.
//!
// To build these docs correctly:
// RUSTFLAGS="--cfg docsrs" cargo doc --featuers cortex-m-systick,rp2040,nrf52840
