# RTFM by example

This part of the book introduces the Real Time For the Masses (RTFM) framework
to new users by walking them through examples of increasing complexity.

All examples in this part of the book can be found in the GitHub [repository] of
the project, and most of the examples can be run on QEMU so no special hardware
is required to follow along.

To run the examples on your laptop / PC you'll need the `qemu-system-arm`
program. Check [the embedded Rust book] for instructions on how to set up an
embedded development environment that includes QEMU.
