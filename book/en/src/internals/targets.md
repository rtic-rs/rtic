# Target Architecture

## Cortex-M Devices

While RTIC can currently target all Cortex-m devices there are some key architecture differences that 
users should be aware of. Namely, the absence of Base Priority Mask Register (`BASEPRI`) which lends
itself exceptionally well to the hardware priority ceiling support used in RTIC, in the ARMv6-M and
ARMv8-M-base architectures, which forces RTIC to use source masking instead. For each implementation
of lock and a detailed commentary of pros and cons, see the implementation of
[lock in src/export.rs][src_export].

[src_export]: https://github.com/rtic-rs/rtic/blob/master/src/export.rs

These differences influence how critical sections are realized, but functionality should be the same
except that ARMv6-M/ARMv8-M-base cannot have tasks with shared resources bound to exception
handlers, as these cannot be masked in hardware.

Table 1 below shows a list of Cortex-m processors and which type of critical section they employ.

### Priority Ceiling

This is covered by the [Resources](../by-example/resources.html) page of this book.

### Source Masking

Without a `BASEPRI` register which allows for directly setting a priority ceiling in the Nested 
Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC), RTIC must instead rely on disabling (masking) interrupts.
Consider Figure 1 below, showing two tasks A and B where A has higher priority but shares a resource
with B.

```

At time *t1*, task B locks the shared resource by selectively disabling (using the NVIC) all other
tasks which have a priority equal to or less than any task which shares resources with B. In effect
this creates a virtual priority ceiling, mirroring the `BASEPRI` approach. Task A is one such task that shares resources with
task B. At time *t2*, task A is either spawned by task B or becomes pending through an interrupt
condition, but does not yet preempt task B even though its priority is greater. This is because the
NVIC is preventing it from starting due to task A being disabled. At time *t3*, task B
releases the lock by re-enabling the tasks in the NVIC. Because task A was pending and has a higher
priority than task B, it immediately preempts task B and is free to use the shared resource without
risk of data race conditions. At time *t4*, task A completes and returns the execution context to B.

Since source masking relies on use of the NVIC, core exception sources such as HardFault, SVCall,
PendSV, and SysTick cannot share data with other tasks.

## RISC-V Devices

All the current RISC-V backends work in a similar way as Cortex-M devices with priority ceiling.
Therefore, the [Resources](../by-example/resources.html) page of this book is a good reference.
However, some of these backends are not full hardware implementations, but use software to emulate
a physical interrupt controller. Therefore, these backends do not implement hardware tasks, and
only software tasks are needed. Furthermore, the number of software tasks for these targets is
not bounded by the number of available physical interrupt sources.

Table 2 below compares the available RISC-V backends.

#### *Table 2: Critical Section Implementation by Processor Architecture*

| Backend                 | Compatible targets            | Backend-specific configuration | Hardware Tasks | Software Tasks | Number of tasks bounded by HW |
| :---------------------: | :---------------------------: | :----------------------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :---------------------------: |
| `riscv-esp32c3-backend` | ESP32-C3 only                 |                                |        ✓       |        ✓       |               ✓               |
| `riscv-mecall-backend`  | Any RISC-V device             |                                |                |        ✓       |                               |
| `riscv-clint-backend`   | Devices with CLINT peripheral |                ✓               |                |        ✓       |                               |


### `riscv-mecall-backend`

It is not necessary to provide a list of dispatchers in the `#[app]` attribute, as RTIC will generate them at compile time.
Priority levels can go from 0 (for the `idle` task) to 255.

### `riscv-clint-backend`

It is not necessary to provide a list of `dispatchers` in the `#[app]` attribute, as RTIC will generate them at compile time.
Priority levels can go from 0 (for the `idle` task) to 255.

You **must** include a `backend`-specific configuration in the `#[app]` attribute so RTIC knows the ID number used to identify the HART running your application.
For example, for `e310x` chips, you would configure a minimal application as follows:

```rust
#[rtic::app(device = e310x, backend = H0)]
mod app {
  // your application here
}
```

In this way, RTIC will always refer to HART `H0`.
