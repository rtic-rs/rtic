# Software tasks & spawn

The RTIC concept of a software task shares a lot with that of [hardware tasks](./hardware_tasks.md). The core difference is that a software task is not explicitly bound to a specific interrupt vector, but rather bound to a “dispatcher” interrupt vector running at the intended priority of the software task (see below).

Similarly to *hardware* tasks, the `#[task]` attribute used on a function declare it as a task. The absence of a `binds = InterruptName` argument to the attribute declares the function as a *software task*. 

The static method `task_name::spawn()` spawns (starts) a software task and given that there are no higher priority tasks running the task will start executing directly.

The *software* task itself is given as an `async` Rust function, which allows the user to optionally `await` future events. This allows to blend reactive programming (by means of *hardware* tasks) with sequential programming (by means of *software* tasks).

While *hardware* tasks are assumed to run-to-completion (and return), *software* tasks may be started (`spawned`) once and run forever, on the condition that any loop (execution path) is broken by at least one `await` (yielding operation).

## Dispatchers

All *software* tasks at the same priority level share an interrupt handler acting as an async executor dispatching the software tasks. This list of dispatchers, `dispatchers = [FreeInterrupt1, FreeInterrupt2, ...]` is an argument to the `#[app]` attribute, where you define the set of free and usable interrupts.

Each interrupt vector acting as dispatcher gets assigned to one priority level meaning that the list of dispatchers need to cover all priority levels used by software tasks.

Example: The `dispatchers =` argument needs to have at least 3 entries for an application using three different priorities for software tasks.

The framework will give a compilation error if there are not enough dispatchers provided, or if a clash occurs between the list of dispatchers and interrupts bound to *hardware* tasks.

See the following example:

``` rust,noplayground
{{#include ../../../../rtic/examples/spawn.rs}}
```

``` console
$ cargo run --target thumbv7m-none-eabi --example spawn
```

``` console
{{#include ../../../../rtic/ci/expected/spawn.run}}
```
You may `spawn` a *software* task again, given that it has run-to-completion (returned). 

In the below example, we `spawn` the *software* task `foo` from the `idle` task. Since the priority of the *software* task is 1 (higher than `idle`), the dispatcher will execute `foo` (preempting `idle`). Since `foo` runs-to-completion. It is ok to `spawn` the `foo` task again.

Technically the async executor will `poll` the `foo` *future* which in this case leaves the *future* in a *completed* state. 

``` rust,noplayground
{{#include ../../../../rtic/examples/spawn_loop.rs}}
```

``` console
$ cargo run --target thumbv7m-none-eabi --example spawn_loop
```

``` console
{{#include ../../../../rtic/ci/expected/spawn_loop.run}}
```

An attempt to `spawn` an already spawned task (running) task will result in an error. Notice, the that the error is reported before the `foo` task is actually run. This is since, the actual execution of the *software* task is handled by the dispatcher interrupt (`SSIO`), which is not enabled until we exit the `init` task. (Remember, `init` runs in a critical section, i.e. all interrupts being disabled.)

Technically, a `spawn` to a *future* that is not in *completed* state is considered an error.

``` rust,noplayground
{{#include ../../../../rtic/examples/spawn_err.rs}}
```

``` console
$ cargo run --target thumbv7m-none-eabi --example spawn_err
```

``` console
{{#include ../../../../rtic/ci/expected/spawn_err.run}}
```

## Passing arguments
You can also pass arguments at spawn as follows.

``` rust,noplayground
{{#include ../../../../rtic/examples/spawn_arguments.rs}}
```

``` console
$ cargo run --target thumbv7m-none-eabi --example spawn_arguments
```

``` console
{{#include ../../../../rtic/ci/expected/spawn_arguments.run}}
```

## Priority zero tasks

In RTIC tasks run preemptively to each other, with priority zero (0) the lowest priority. You can use priority zero tasks for background work, without any strict real-time requirements. 

Conceptually, one can see such tasks as running in the `main` thread of the application, thus the resources associated are not required the [Send] bound.

``` rust,noplayground
{{#include ../../../../rtic/examples/zero-prio-task.rs}}
```

``` console
$ cargo run --target thumbv7m-none-eabi --example zero-prio-task
```

``` console
{{#include ../../../../rtic/ci/expected/zero-prio-task.run}}
```

> **Notice**: *software* task at zero priority cannot co-exist with the [idle] task. The reason is that `idle` is running as a non-returning Rust function at priority zero. Thus there would be no way for an executor at priority zero to give control to *software* tasks at the same priority.

---

Application side safety: Technically, the RTIC framework ensures that `poll` is never executed on any *software* task with *completed* future, thus adhering to the soundness rules of async Rust.
