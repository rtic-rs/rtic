# Using indirection for faster message passing

Message passing always involves copying the payload from the sender into a static variable and then from the static variable into the receiver. Thus sending a large buffer, like a `[u8; 128]`, as a message involves two expensive
`memcpy`s.

Indirection can minimize message passing overhead: instead of sending the buffer by value, one can send an owning pointer into the buffer.

One can use a global memory allocator to achieve indirection (`alloc::Box`, `alloc::Rc`, etc.), which requires using the nightly channel as of Rust v1.37.0, or one can use a statically allocated memory pool like [`heapless::Pool`].

[`heapless::Pool`]: https://docs.rs/heapless/latest/heapless/pool/index.html

As this example of approach goes completely outside of RTIC resource model with shared and local the program would rely on the correctness of the memory allocator, in this case `heapless::pool`.

Here's an example where `heapless::Pool` is used to "box" buffers of 128 bytes.

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../../../../../examples/lm3s6965/examples/pool.rs}}
```

```console
$ cargo xtask qemu --verbose --example pool
```

```console
{{#include ../../../../../ci/expected/lm3s6965/pool.run}}
```
