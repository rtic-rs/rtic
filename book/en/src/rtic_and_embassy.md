# RTIC vs. Embassy

## Differences

Embassy provides both Hardware Abstraction Layers, and an executor/runtime, while RTIC aims to only provide an execution framework. For example, embassy provides `embassy-stm32` (a HAL), and `embassy-executor` (an executor). On the other hand, RTIC provides the framework in the form of [`rtic`], and the user is responsible for providing a PAC and HAL implementation (generally from the [`stm32-rs`] project).

Additionally, RTIC aims to provide exclusive access to resources at as low a level as possible, ideally guarded by some form of hardware protection. This allows for access to hardware without necessarily requiring locking mechanisms at the software level.

## Mixing use of Embassy and RTIC

Since most Embassy and RTIC libraries are runtime agnostic, many details from one project can be used in the other. For example, using [`rtic-monotonics`] in an `embassy-executor` powered project works, and using [`embassy-sync`] (though [`rtic-sync`] is recommended) in an RTIC project works.
